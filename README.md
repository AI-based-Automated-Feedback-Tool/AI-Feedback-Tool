### 📊 Prompt Preview

When a style is selected, a predefined **prompt structure** is displayed in the preview box. Teachers can review or modify it if using the custom prompt option.

> Example (MCQ Standard Prompt):


Analyze these exam results and provide feedback in this exact JSON structure:

```json
{
  "overallSummary": "Brief 2-3 sentence summary of class performance",
  "keyStrengths": [
    "List 3-5 concepts students mastered well",
    "Include specific question numbers or short titles as evidence (avoid internal IDs or UUIDs)"
  ],
  "mostMissedQuestions": [
    "Top 3-5 questions students struggled with",
    "Briefly explain the misconceptions",
    "Use question numbers or short question titles instead of technical IDs"
  ],
  "teachingSuggestions": [
    "2-3 specific reteaching strategies",
    "Activity ideas to reinforce weak areas"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Immediate actions for the teacher",
    "Follow-up assessment ideas"
  ]
}

```
IMPORTANT:
- Use question numbers (e.g. Q1, Q2) or short titles from the Questions array for references.
- DO NOT use internal IDs or UUIDs in the response.
- Return ONLY valid JSON with these exact keys.

Questions: [QUESTIONS]
Submissions: [SUBMISSIONS]
Answers: [ANSWERS]



## ⛔ API Call Limiting

To maintain system performance and ensure fair usage of AI resources, the **AI Feedback Generator** includes a built-in **daily API call limit**.

### 🔢 Daily Limit

- Each user is allowed up to **10 AI feedback generations per day**.
- This applies globally to all exam types (MCQ, Code, Essay).
- The count resets automatically **at midnight (UTC)**.

### 🧠 How It Works

- A counter at the top-right corner of the interface shows:
  
  **`API Calls Today: 3/10`**

- Every time a teacher clicks **"Generate Feedback"**, it adds **1** to the count.
- Once the **limit is reached**, the system:
  - Shows a warning alert
  - Disables the **Generate Feedback** button
  - Prevents further API calls until the next day

### ⚠️ API Limit Reached — Example Message

> "You’ve reached your daily limit of 10 AI feedback requests. Please try again tomorrow."

### ✅ Best Practices

- Prioritize generating feedback only after finalizing:
  - Exam selection
  - AI provider
  - Prompt style or custom prompt
- Use the **Custom Prompt** feature to preview and edit prompts before sending to AI.
- Avoid unnecessary test clicks to preserve your quota.

### 🚀 Coming Soon (Planned Enhancements)

- Admin-configurable quota settings
- Role-based limits (e.g., more calls for premium users)
- API usage history logs
