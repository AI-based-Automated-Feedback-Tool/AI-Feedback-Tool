## üéôÔ∏è Narration Script ‚Äì Video 5: AI Feedback Generation

Hi, and welcome to the fifth video in our **AI-Based Automated Feedback Tool** series ‚Äî a group project developed during the summer of 2025.

In this video, we‚Äôll walk you through how teachers can generate AI-powered feedback for completed exams using our intuitive interface.

Once you open the **AI Feedback** page, you‚Äôll arrive at the **AI Feedback Selector** interface.

Here, the teacher begins by selecting a **course** from the dropdown.  
Only the courses assigned to that teacher will appear in the list.

Next, the teacher selects the **type of exam** they wish to review ‚Äî either **MCQ**, **Essay**, or **Code**.

Based on the selected course and exam type, the system filters and displays a list of matching exams.  
Once the preferred exam is selected, its details are displayed automatically ‚Äî including the title, duration, number of questions, exam type, and any student-facing instructions.  
This helps verify that the correct exam has been chosen before generating feedback.

When ready, the teacher clicks **Proceed to AI Feedback**.

They are now taken to the **AI Feedback Generator Page**.

At the top, there‚Äôs a dropdown labeled **AI Feedback Provider**, where the teacher can choose which AI API to use.  
Currently, the tool supports **free APIs** like **Cohere AI** and **OpenRouter AI**.

Next, the teacher selects a **Feedback Style** ‚Äî which loads predefined AI prompts to guide the feedback generation.  
These styles are tailored to the exam type.
