## 🎙️ Narration Script – Video 5: AI Feedback Generation

Hi, and welcome to the fifth video in our **AI-Based Automated Feedback Tool** series — a group project developed during the summer of 2025.

In this video, we’ll walk you through how teachers can generate AI-powered feedback for completed exams using our intuitive interface.

Once you open the **AI Feedback** page, you’ll arrive at the **AI Feedback Selector** interface.

Here, the teacher begins by selecting a **course** from the dropdown.  
Only the courses assigned to that teacher will appear in the list.

Next, the teacher selects the **type of exam** they wish to review — either **MCQ**, **Essay**, or **Code**.

Based on the selected course and exam type, the system filters and displays a list of matching exams.  
Once the preferred exam is selected, its details are displayed automatically — including the title, duration, number of questions, exam type, and any student-facing instructions.  
This helps verify that the correct exam has been chosen before generating feedback.
