## üéôÔ∏è Narration Script ‚Äì Video 5: AI Feedback Generation

Hi, and welcome to the fifth video in our **AI-Based Automated Feedback Tool** series ‚Äî a group project developed during the summer of 2025.

In this video, we‚Äôll walk you through how teachers can generate AI-powered feedback for completed exams using our intuitive interface.

---

Once you open the **AI Feedback** page, you‚Äôll arrive at the **AI Feedback Selector** interface.

Here, the teacher begins by selecting a **course** from the dropdown.  
Only the courses assigned to that teacher will appear in the list.

Next, the teacher selects the **type of exam** they wish to review ‚Äî either **MCQ**, **Essay**, or **Code**.

Based on the selected course and exam type, the system filters and displays a list of matching exams.  
Once the preferred exam is selected, its details are displayed automatically ‚Äî including the title, duration, number of questions, exam type, and any student-facing instructions.  
This helps verify that the correct exam has been chosen before generating feedback.

---

When ready, the teacher clicks **Proceed to AI Feedback**.

They are now taken to the **AI Feedback Generator Page**.

At the top, there‚Äôs a dropdown labeled **AI Feedback Provider**, where the teacher can choose which AI API to use.  
Currently, the tool supports **free APIs** like **Cohere AI** and **OpenRouter AI**.

Next, the teacher selects a **Feedback Style** ‚Äî which loads predefined AI prompts to guide the feedback generation.  
These styles are tailored to the exam type.

### üéØ Available Feedback Styles:

#### MCQ Exams:
- Standard Analysis  
- Quick Insight  
- Detailed Report  
- Custom Prompt  

#### Code Exams:
- Error Analysis  
- Optimization Tips  
- Code Style Review  
- Custom Prompt  

#### Essay Exams:
- Content & Relevance Focus  
- General Essay Feedback  
- Technical Accuracy & Completeness  
- Custom Prompt  

If the **Custom Prompt** option is selected, the teacher can enter their own prompt ‚Äî giving full control over how the AI responds.

---

Once the feedback style is chosen, or a custom prompt is written, the teacher clicks **Generate Feedback**.

The system then gathers all relevant data:
- The selected exam‚Äôs metadata  
- The students‚Äô submitted answers and performance  

It combines this with the selected prompt and sends a request to the chosen AI provider.

After a short wait, the AI-generated feedback is returned ‚Äî beautifully formatted to maximize clarity and usefulness.

---

Teachers can also refine the feedback by clicking **Modify Prompt**.  
This brings them back to the generator page, where they can try a different style or adjust their custom prompt to get exactly the insight they need.

There‚Äôs also an option to **download the feedback as a .txt file**, using the **Download Feedback** button ‚Äî great for saving or sharing.

---

The system includes a built-in **API call limiter**.  
Each teacher is allowed up to **10 feedback requests per day**.

A counter at the top tracks usage in real time.  
If the limit is reached, the **Generate Feedback** button is disabled, and a message appears asking the teacher to try again tomorrow.

This helps us control usage and keep costs low, especially when using paid AI APIs.

---

And that‚Äôs how our AI Feedback Generator works ‚Äî giving teachers intelligent, flexible, and efficient insights into student performance.

Thanks for watching.  
In the next video, we‚Äôll show you how students interact with the system ‚Äî and how they receive and review the feedback automatically generated by AI.
