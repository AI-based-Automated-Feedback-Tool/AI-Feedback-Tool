### 📝 Creating MCQs – Step by Step

Once the exam is configured, we move to the **Create MCQ Questions** interface.

Here’s how the process works:

- **Enter the question text** clearly in the input box.
- Add multiple **answer options** for the question.
- Specify **how many answers are correct**.  
  > This allows creating questions with one or more correct answers.
- Then, from the list of added answers, **select the correct ones**.
- Enter the number of **points** the question carries.  
  > This helps control the weight of each question.

Once completed, click **Save Question**.  
The question will be saved to the database and displayed below in a list format.
