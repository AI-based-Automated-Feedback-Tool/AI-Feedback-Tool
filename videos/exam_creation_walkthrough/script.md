## 🎥 Video 4: Creating MCQ Questions

Hi, and welcome to the fourth video of our **AI-Based Automated Feedback Tool**, a group project we developed during the summer of 2025.

In this video, we’ll walk through how to create Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for an exam.

### 📝 Creating MCQs – Step by Step

Once the exam is configured, we move to the **Create MCQ Questions** interface.

Here’s how the process works:

- **Enter the question text** clearly in the input box.
- Add multiple **answer options** for the question.
- Specify **how many answers are correct**.  
  > This allows creating questions with one or more correct answers.
- Then, from the list of added answers, **select the correct ones**.
- Enter the number of **points** the question carries.  
  > This helps control the weight of each question.

Once completed, click **Save Question**.  
The question will be saved to the database and displayed below in a list format.

### 🛠 Managing Questions

- Teachers can continue **adding more questions one by one**.
- All saved questions are displayed in a **table view below**.
- You can **edit** or **delete** questions using the provided action buttons.

After all questions are created, clicking **Save All Questions** finalizes the process.

The exam is now fully created and appears in the **teacher’s dashboard**.  
If the exam’s scheduled start time has passed, it will also appear in the **student dashboard** with a **Start Exam** option.
